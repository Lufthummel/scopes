These scopes are intended as components that can be used by developers to implement scope capabilities in their video or image solutions. The scopes are typically used during color correction and grading stage and provides valuable information of what needs to be corrected or adjusted. The scopes are professional grade using standard BT.709, BT.2020 and BT.601 as well as linear luma conversion, but is limited to 8-bit values due to browser limitations. The scope package includes Histogram, Waveform, RGB Parade and Vector scopes. It is assumed you are familiar with the concepts and usage of video scopes. GPL2 and commercial licenses available, see below for more details. Features (alpha/preview) Histogram scope with support for individual R/G/B channels as well as luma and in combinations. Waveform scope with support for R/G/B or luma RGB Parade scope Vector scope for RGB (YUV is not supported at the moment as it's not common in use) using linear projection. Real-time scoping with various quality settings for some scopes Accurate representation. BT./Rec.709, BT./Rec.2020, BT./Rec.601 as well as linear luma conversion Configurable Possible future implementations: 2D Histogram Luma tracker (useful for time-lapse recordings) Vector scope representing YUV (not commonly used) DemoOnline demo can be found here.

Parameters: Name Type Description source * Image, Video, Canvas element for source target HTMLCanvasElement target canvas to draw resulting scope to options * options (see below) Properties Name Type Argument Default Description quality number &lt;optional&gt; 2 values 1, 2, 4 determines scope quality for some scopes scopeType string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;histogram&quot; either &quot;histogram&quot;, &quot;waveform&quot;, &quot;parade&quot; or &quot;vector&quot; lumaType string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;709&quot; either &quot;709&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;, &quot;601&quot; or &quot;linear&quot; interpolate boolean &lt;optional&gt; false interpolate output scope or not show string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;RGB&quot; which channels to show. Available channels varies depending on scope-type. scopeAlpha boolean &lt;optional&gt; false use or ignore alpha channel of scope canvas intensity number &lt;optional&gt; 16 value between 1 and 100. Determines intensity of scope pixels depending on scope-type Methods intensity( [newInt]) Intensity value for the scopes. Does not affect the data, only the rendering of the data. Value 0 is not a valid value. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description newInt number &lt;optional&gt; new value [1, 100] Returns: Type * interpolate( [state]) A secondary quality setting. To increase performance internal image interpolation can be switched off. This increase performance but reduce accuracy. If defaults to off. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description state boolean &lt;optional&gt; false Turn on or off internal image interpolation Returns: Type * lumaType( [type]) The luma channel can be converted from RGB in various. It defaults to industry standard BT.709. Also BT.2020, BT.601 and linear conversion are supported. An unsupported name will default to &quot;709&quot;. If no argument is given, current luma type is returned. NOTE: Although BT.2020 conversion is supported it is just an approximation due to the browser being limit to 8-bit values. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description type string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;709&quot; luma conversion scheme, valid values: 2020, 709 (default), 601, linear Returns: Type function | * | boolean | string quality( [q]) Quality setting for some of the scopes. Reducing quality can improve performance at the cost of some accuracy. The value must be in steps of 2^n; only 1, 2, 4 and 8 are supported where 1 is best, 8 is fastest. If no argument is given, current quality setting is returned. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description q number &lt;optional&gt; 2 new quality, 1, 2, 4 or 8. Returns: Type function | * | boolean | number refresh() If target canvas was for some reason changed or resized, this call will setup the internal metrics for that to match the new size and so forth. scopeType( [type]) Get or set a scope type. If no argument is given, the current type will be returned as a string. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description type string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;histogram&quot; scope type, valid values: histogram, waveform, parade, vector Returns: Type * show( [channels]) Which components to show in the scope. Not all scopes supports all combination. Use support() to list which channels and combinations are supported. The new channels are given as abbreviations for thw channel, f.ex. &quot;RGBL&quot; is red, green, blue and luminance channels. If no argument is given, current channels are returned instead as an upper-case string. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description channels string &lt;optional&gt; &quot;RGB&quot; valid value channels: R, G, B, L Returns: Type * support( [type]) Returns supported settings for either the current scope type or the one given if any. An object is returned with properties set to true or false depending on what the scope supports. F.ex. RGB parade or vector scope will return false for the L channel. Use this to set up options for things like what channel combinations are allowed etc. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description type string &lt;optional&gt; optional scope type, otherwise current Returns: Type * update() Grab a snapshot of current video or image source, analyse and update current scope.
