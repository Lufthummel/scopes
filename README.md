Scopes
======

Real-time professional video scopes for modern web browsers.

These scopes are intended as components that can be used by developers
to implement scope capabilities in their video solutions. The scopes are
used during color correction and grading stage and provides valuable
information of what needs to be corrected or adjusted.

The scopes are professional grade using standard BT.601 and BT.709 luma
conversion, but limited to 8-bit due to browser limitations.

The scope package includes:

- Histogram scope (RGB, R, G, B, luma, RGB + luma channels)
